## Prerequisites
Before running the program, ensure that you have the following:
- Python installed on your machine

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. If you don't have tabulate : `pip install tabulate` 
4. Run the following command: `python main.py` or `pypy3 main.py`
5. The game will start, and you will be prompted for your actions as the human player  (You can only play with whites for the moment, Bot plays with blacks).

## Alpha-Beta Algorithm
The chess bot utilizes the Alpha-Beta algorithm, which is a search algorithm commonly used in game-playing scenarios. It evaluates different possible moves and determines the best move based on a scoring system.
